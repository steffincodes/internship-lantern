#Lantern

So we are trying to provide an experience that is grounded in emotions and moods. People would like to have an online platform which is focused internally. We want people to come to Lantern to explore their moods and emotions. If someone is feeling anxious and nervous, we want then to use the app and come out of it more confident and calm. Similar use cases could be defined for the other main moods. We are basically trying to offer them the services of a really good friend or a mother, on the internet!
